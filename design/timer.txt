CPU0 - Runs threads A and B
CPU1 - Runs threads C and D

1. Thread A is scheduled onto CPU0, with the LAPIC timer set to interrupt in 1ms
2. Thread C is scheduled onto CPU1, with the LAPIC timer set to interrupt in 1ms
3. Thread A enters a wait state for 2ms
4. Kernel sets thread A's waiting time to 2ms and puts it on the per-CPU timer queue
5. Thread B is scheduled onto CPU0
6. LAPIC timer interrupt occurs
	1. Thread A, at the head of the sleep queue, has its wait time changed to 1ms
7. Thread B is scheduled onto CPU0 again, since it's the only one, with the LAPIC timer set to interrupt in 1ms
8. LAPIC timer interrupt occurs
	1. Thread A, at the head of the sleep queue, has its wait time changed to 0ms
	2. Thread A is put onto CPU0's queue
9. Thread A is scheduled onto CPU0, with the LAPIC timer set to interrupt in 1ms
10.
