Bootloader firmware initialization - BIOS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Attempt to initialize ACPI
	-Search for an RSDP with a valid signature and checksum
	-If RSDP is not found
		-ACPI initialization failed
	-If we're using the extended RSDP
		-Map the XSDT into memory
		-Verify its signature and checksum
		-If signature or checksum does not match
			-ACPI initialization failed
		-ACPI initialization succeeded
	-Otherwise
		-Map the RSDT into memory
		-Verify its signature and checksum
		-If signature or checksum does not match
			-ACPI initialization failed
		-ACPI initialization succeeded
	-Record the RSDP, RSDT, and XSDT physical addresses in the loader block
-If initializing ACPI failed, try to initialize the MP tables
	-Search for an MP floating point table with a valid signature and checksum
	-If MP floating point table is not found
		-MP initialization failed
	-Map the MP table into memory
	-Verify its signature and checksum
	-If signature or checksum do not match
		-MP initialization failed
-Otherwise, we're on a uniprocessor system

Bootloader CPU detection - BIOS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-If using ACPI
	-Get the MADT
	-If getting the MADT failed
		-Allocate a per-CPU data area
		-Set its Local APIC ID to 0
		-Set its NUMA domain to NULL
		-Set its flags to 1 (bootable)
		-Record the number of CPUs (1)
	-Otherwise
		-For each xLAPIC entry or x2LAPIC entry
			-Allocate a per-CPU data area
			-Set its Local APIC ID to the one specified
			-Set its flags to the ones specified
			-Increment the number of CPUs
-If using MP
	-For each Local APIC entry
		-Allocate a per-CPU data area
		-Set its Local APIC ID to the one specified
		-Set its flags to the one specified
		-Increment the number of CPUs
	-If there are 0 CPUs found
		-Allocate a per-CPU data area
		-Set its Local APIC ID to 0
		-Set its NUMA domain to NULL
		-Set its flags to 1 (bootable)
		-Record the number of CPUs (1)
-Otherwise
	-Allocate a per-CPU data area
	-Set its Local APIC ID to 0
	-Set its NUMA domain to NULL
	-Set its flags to 1 (bootable)
	-Record the number of CPUs (1)

Bootloader NUMA domain detection - BIOS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-If using ACPI
	-Get the SRAT
	-If getting the SRAT failed
		-Allocate a per-CPU data area
		-Set its Local APIC ID to 0
		-Set its NUMA domain to NULL
		-Set its flags to 1 (bootable)
		-Record the number of CPUs (1)
